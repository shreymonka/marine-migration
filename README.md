# Whale Watch Dashboard

**Whale Watch** is an interactive Streamlit dashboard designed to monitor humpback whale migration patterns, feeding conditions, and breeding behaviors in Holyrood waters. The dashboard integrates real-time sensor data, historical migration information, and species data sourced from organizations such as Ocean Networks Canada, DFO Canada, and Memorial University Research.

## Features

- **Interactive Tabs:**
  - **About Humpback Whales:** Provides an overview, key characteristics, and interesting facts about humpback whales.
  - **Lifecycle Phases:** Detailed insights into the breeding, feeding, migration, and resting phases.
  - **Feeding Conditions:** Visualizations of key environmental factors (e.g., chlorophyll, pH, temperature) that influence feeding behavior.
  - **Migration Patterns:** Dynamic charts showing species presence and seasonal migration trends.
  - **Breeding Conditions:** Graphs and analysis of environmental parameters affecting breeding.
  - **Data Sources:** A dedicated section listing useful references and citations.

- **Dynamic Visualizations:**
  - Uses Plotly to generate interactive time-series and bar charts.
  - Responsive design ensures the dashboard works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Real-Time Data Integration:**
  - Leverages real-time sensor data from Ocean Networks Canada and historical datasets for comprehensive analysis.
